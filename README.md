# Joint Design Improvement using FEA

This project focuses on improving the durability and performance of a mechanical joint through optimized design and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) simulation. The goal is to evaluate the enhanced design against the original model and validate improvements based on stress distribution and safety factor.

## 📌 Objective

- Improve the strength and robustness of the given joint design.
- Conduct Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to validate the new design.
- Compare results with the baseline (original) design.
